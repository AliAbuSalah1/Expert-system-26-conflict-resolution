## Student Modification
I implemented a conflict resolution mechanism using rule priority (salience) in Experta.

- Modified the Videocassette rule to be more general and assigned it a lower priority.
- Added a more specific Online Course rule with higher priority when feedback is required.
- Created a conflict test case (Visual + Documented + Feedback Required) to demonstrate how salience resolves rule conflicts and produces a single final decision.
